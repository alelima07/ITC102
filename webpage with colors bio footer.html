    <h1>Alessandra Lima</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am Alessandra Lima, 27 years old, originally from Brazil. I look forward to learning Computer Science and growing in this field. My big goal is to study at Seattle Central College for two years and then transfer to an university in the Seattle area.</p>
    <p>I moved to the USA in 2017, fell in love with the country and decided to get a degree. So far, it's been a great learning experience.</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/12/06/11/03/brazil-3001462_960_720.png" style="width: 250px;height: 200px">
    
<h1>Linda Danh</h1>
	<p>Hello all, my name is Linda Danh and I am a 28 year old female that attends Seattle Central Community College. I'm here to acquire my AA transfer degree in programming and hopefully be getting my bachelors degree at UW Bothell for Computer Science & Software Engineering.<p>
    <p>My parents immigrated here in 1985 from Vietnam to achieve a better life for my siblings and me. I am the youngest of three. My current occupation is an international banking specialist at U.S. Bank in downtown Seattle. I've been working for the banking industry for 8 years and decided to have a career change into programming.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Flag_of_Vietnam.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Vietnam.svg.png" style="width: 250px;height: 200px">
